# Stock-Market-Predictor

## Abstract

This mini-project has been performed on the topic of ”Stock Market Prediction” <b> using APIs (Application Programming Interface) to fetch real-time data, Deep Learning LSTM (Long Short Term Memory Network) model to predict stock prices and a webpage made using Streamlit to visualize the data and communicate the results. </b> <br>
We have chosen this topic to work with time series data as it can be applied to other fields such as patient history in healthcare, employee experience in corporate sector and more. <b> This mini-project successfully predicts the stock prices for Apple, Google and Microsoft using data from the NASDAQ stock exchange. </b> It can further be extended to include more companies data and improve the model’s performance in both accuracy and compute time.

## Results

The result of our project is a web page which allows users to select which company they
want see data about and its associated graphs for the datasets and predictions.
